Watch and Code Beasts - Nested Todos
=======================================

Create an application that houses a small todo list.
Much like a typical todo list, this application should be able to:

1) Add todos
2) Delete todos
3) Edit todos
4) Complete todos

However, in addition to this functionality this todo list has 1 special feature.
The special feature of this todo list is that every todo in this list should be able to have its own "nested" todo.
This means that each todo should be able to hold an unnlimited number of nested todos.

Example of a normal todo list:
- First todo
- Second todo

Example of a nested todo list:
- First todo
  - First nested todo
